I will list here features that I think might be interesting to add to the extension. Feel free to suggest more and/or contribute in it's development too!
I will also list here some misbehaviors and/or bugs that I'd like to correct when I have time.

New Features List:
  * Easy definition of images source folder for InfoWindows
  * Line weight dynamic calculation for larger and thinner subpaths within line path
  * Line color dynamic calculation for subpaths within a line path
  * Lasso selection
  * Parallel loading of points for larger sets
  * Layering of components

Misbehaviors and/or bugs (critical and in top of the list to solve)
  * After doing selections in the extension, sometimes it generates additional hypercubes, even if the feature is not requested in the extension's configuration
  * Google API does not seem to receive correctly the need to support touch interactivity to move/zoom the map around
